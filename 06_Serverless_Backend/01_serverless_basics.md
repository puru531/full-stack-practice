# Introduction to Serverless Backend

## What is Serverless?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider automatically manages the infrastructure needed to run your code. Despite its name, servers are still involved - they're just abstracted away from the developer.

## Key Characteristics

1. **No Server Management**: Developers don't need to worry about server provisioning or maintenance
2. **Auto-scaling**: Applications automatically scale based on demand
3. **Pay-per-use**: You only pay for the actual compute time used
4. **Event-driven**: Functions are triggered by events

## Core Benefits

- **Reduced Operational Costs**: No need to pay for idle server time
- **Increased Developer Productivity**: Focus on code, not infrastructure
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles varying workloads efficiently
- **Reduced Time-to-Market**: Faster deployment and iteration

## Common Use Cases

1. API backends
2. Data processing
3. Real-time file processing
4. Scheduled tasks
5. Chat bots
6. IoT backends

## Popular Serverless Platforms

1. AWS Lambda
2. Azure Functions
3. Google Cloud Functions
4. IBM Cloud Functions
